# # Statement of Darcy's Law
# 
# By the mid-19th Century Henry Darcy proposed a theory that relates hydraulic head with the flux of water through a porous medium. This is known as Darcy's Law, here for 1D:
# 
# $q = -\frac{h_2 - h_1}{x_2 - x1} k = -\frac{\Delta h}{\Delta x} k$
# 
# Darcy's Law constitutes one of the most important laws to describe groundwater flow. In this formula $x_1$ and $x_2$ describe the position of the two applied hydraulic heads $h_1$ and $h_2$, respectively. $q$ is the resulting flux through the medium. $k$ is the so-called hydraulic conductivity. In the next section you will learn more about the meaning and application of Darcy's Law and its constituents.
